S1 POA - Unearth

- Target environment is command line Objective-C.
	-- See CmdLineWithObjects project for stub template 
				
- Organization of Components, Issues, Challenges, Subsystems (CICS?)
	-- Game foundation; e.g. board, players, core play sequence driver (aka engine)
	-- Rules engine (e.g. tracks delver card in play modifies turn to allow re-roll)
	-- Game specific components 
		(Delvers, ruins, ruin end cards, delver cards, stones, player stone placement map, wonders)

> CLI Methods
    get(int|are|float, msgID)
    put(msg)
    draw(player Jewel map)
    // Start with put for card output test, just stub get()

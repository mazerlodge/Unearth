S1 POA - Unearth

- Target environment is command line Objective-C.
	-- See CmdLineWithObjects project for stub template 
				
- Organization of Components, Issues, Challenges, Subsystems (CICS?)
	-- Game foundation; e.g. board, players, core play sequence driver (aka engine)
	-- Rules engine (e.g. tracks delver card in play modifies turn to allow re-roll)
	-- Game specific components 
		(Delvers, ruins, ruin end cards, delver cards, stones, player stone placement map, wonders)

06/18 (M)
    - Expanded main to include packaging of arguments into ArgParser
    - Added argParser class files to project
    - Created stub of validateArguments() function
    - Corrected bug in string comparision of ArgParser's doesArg: haveValue: method

    - Reorg POA next tasks
    - Started use cases document (help drive class method definition) 0616
    - Created stub of game factory and engine classes (see Object Library.txt) 0616
    - Modify main.m to invoke game engine class 0616
    - Expanded main's validateArguments() function 0620

07/23 (M)
    - Make UGF earlier in main() so it can replace showUsage() & validateArgs() found locally in main.m 0701
    - Move validate arguments logic into UGF class 0701
    - Move showUsage() message generation to UGF class 0701

08/15
    - Created ArgParser.populateArgParserFromString() method, to be used by UGF.makeGame() method 0701

08/19
    - Decided on technique for storing static string info (e.g. card data) in plists
    - Expanded POA
    - Tested ability to define and reach typedef enumerations (see UnearthPlayer.h and UGF.m)
    - Stubbed out remaining classes

08/31
    - added test case to read scanf() input in a limited fashion.
    - streamlined startup to accept -action defaultstartup and select makeGame() or makeGamewithArgs() appropriately.
    - added doTest() hook and moved existing test code to two methods
    - added validateArguments test for doTest requiring test number be specified in -test argument

09/02
    - Stubbed in CommandLineInterface (CLI) class
    - Added test 3 to excercise CLI class

09/23
    - Added note file with ID, text and count of delver cards.

10/05
    - Used Sklyar/DictionaryPatternToPList project to convert Delver card text to plist.
    - Added data directory to project and put DelverCards.plist in it.

10/13
    - Search // TDOO: for additional tasks

10/21
    - Made AP.dumpArgs method & invoked in UGF.validateArguments()

11/02
    - Added test cases to read delver card plist files using hard coded folder.

11/03
    - Added/modified test cases to load delver cards from NSURL instead of NSString
    - Added test cases to read plist files from relative path of build folder.
    - Added test cases to read from NSBundle, and modified build instructions to copy QData folder to output dir
    - Added test to get app support folder (/Library/App Support...) and create Unearth folder and log file there.
    - Added populating of dictionary member for QConfig data in UGF class and added CLI member as well.
    - Replaced printf() calls in UGF for testscanf() function w/ CLI methods
    - Moved default startup params to QConfig file

11/11
    - Genericized card reading from plist into generic getDataForQConfigKey(), to be reuable across all card data files.

11/17
    - Deprecated UGF.makeGame() by changing name to z_makeGame() and added comment

> In-Progress:

    Sample Current Invocation:
    unearth -action dotest - test 1 -debug
    -or-
    unearth -action defaultstartup
        Note: in this case, the startup params come from QConfig.plist, key [DefaultStartupParams] value.


> Next:
    - Eliminate UGF.makeGame() and focus on makeGameWithArgs(), need arg parser 0 for executable path info.
    - Flesh out UnearthGameFactory.makeGameWithArgs() method 0701
    - UGF build decks from plist. 0819
        1. NSMutableArray *fields = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:3];
        2. [fields writeToFile:@"/tmp/DictionaryPatternsToPlist.plist" atomically:YES]
    - Add start up tests, details in [S1 Use Cases - Unearth.txt] 0819
    - Continue use cases document (help drive class method definition) 0819
    - Continue fleshing out object library classes from notes 0819
    - Prototype test of technique for storing static string info (e.g. card data) 0819
    - Test ability to cast HexTile up and down (req. by base class used in hexMap) 0819
    - Implement drawMap() method of CLI class, see TODO marker. 0902
    - Replace test numbers within UGF with enumeration 0902
    - Add call CLI from within validate args, eg collect test number 0909
    - Read Delver Cards plist file (use hard coded path to get things going) 1006
    - Define set of default params to be used w/ UGF.makeGame generic method, see TODO marker. 1013
    - Expand UGE.makeGameWithArgs to handle addn'l -action param values, see TODO marker. 1013
    - Make AP.isInArgs method case insensitive & add a ver w/ a caseSensitive: T/F param, see TODO marker. 1013 1103
    - Add debug logging class w/ output to file 0620 1103
    - Add -debug levels, if debug message is less than or equal to the level specified it prints. 0620 1103

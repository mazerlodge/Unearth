	Program ended with exit code: 0

What should happen next: 
	- On a players turn there are two phases 
		-- Delver phase 
		-- Excavation phase 

	- General action a player can they do (need to make a list of possible actions) 
		look at delver cards 
		look at ruin cards 
		see the board 
		quit game 

	- Q: should control pass to player, e.g. player.doTurn() or stay in UGE, e.g. UGE.doTurn(player) 
			seems like we'd have to pass the game into the player, circular ref issues. 
			In the MVC architecture, the player is a Model, not a Controller, so not passing control in seems OK 
			Staying in UGE has advantage of game elements are already available. 

	- Need to put an overall game control loop inside Go, looping until End of Game state is reached 
		Game state needed 

Pseudo Next 
	set currentPlayerIndex = 0; 
	show message 'player x, what action (or say help)'

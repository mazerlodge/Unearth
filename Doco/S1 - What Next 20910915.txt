S1 - Whats Next 20910915

Current 'playGame' startup, what happens (with -debug -debuglevel 100)
	How many players?2
	Collecting info for player  #1.
	Select player type (0=human, 1=ai)? 0
	Select die color (0=Orange, 1=Yellow, 2=Green, 3=Blue)?3
	Enter unused name for player: Paul
	Collecting info for player  #2.
	Select player type (0=human, 1=ai)? 1
	Select die color (0=Orange, 1=Yellow, 2=Green)?0
	Enter unused name for player: Mac
	Inside of UnearthGameEngine.
	Game has 2 players.
	Program ended with exit code: 0

What should happen next: 
	- Put the lesser and greater wonder cards on the table w/ shuffled tokens on them (tokens have varying values)
		-- Note lesser/greater wonders were implemented as invididual instances of the Wonder class.
	- Players roll to see who goes first (Rules don't specify which die, d6 would work)
		-- Create a currentPlayerIdx in the UGE class.

	- On a players turn there are two phases 
		-- Delver phase 
		-- Excavation phase 

	- General action a player can they do (need to make a list of possible actions) 
		look at delver cards 
		look at ruin cards 
		see the board 
	- Q: should control pass to player, e.g. player.doTurn()
			seems like we'd have to pass the game into the player, circular ref issues. 
			In the MVC architecture, the player is a Model, not a Controller, so not passing control in seems OK 

	- Need to put an overall game control loop inside Go, looping until End of Game state is reached 
		Game state needed 

Pseudo Next 
	set currentPlayerIndex = 0; 
	show message 'player x, what action (or say help)'

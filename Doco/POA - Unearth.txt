S1 POA - Unearth

- Target environment is command line Objective-C.
	-- See CmdLineWithObjects project for stub template 
				
- Organization of Components, Issues, Challenges, Subsystems (CICS?)
	-- Game foundation; e.g. board, players, core play sequence driver (aka engine)
	-- Rules engine (e.g. tracks delver card in play modifies turn to allow re-roll)
	-- Game specific components 
		(Delvers, ruins, ruin end cards, delver cards, stones, player stone placement map, wonders)

> In-Progress:
    - UC U1. Populate a player map with a lesser wonder surrounded with a mix of colors
		X-- Continue UGF.testPlayerMap(), placement of stone in available cells.
		X-- Test Player Hex Map, see [Task Notes - Test Player Hex Map.txt] 0819
		X-- Hex Map, flesh out Hex Map addStone method 1223
		X-- Implement basis of drawMap() method of HexMap class
		/-- Hex Map, flesh out Hex Map addWonder method 1223
        .-- Add printing of wonder information in HexMap.drawCell() method. 
        .-- WonderpopulateWonderFromString() Need to set point value & id for lesser/greater, may have to change flow. 0601

S1 Use Cases - Unearth

Goal - Define use cases for incremental development of the Unearth project.

> Scratch Examples
- Start the game engine with a '-test 1' parameter that generates required params to do a simple "power on" sequence.
    -- Test 1 outputs shuffled deck contents

> Tests (via -action dotest) 
    T1. Generate unshuffled decks, output them.
    T2. Collect all player questions, stores in player, outputs answers.
    T3. Generate shuffled decks, output them.

> Unit tests
    U1. Populate a player map with a lesser wonder surrounded with mix of colors.
    U2. Fully populate UGE from UGF via dictionary passed into UGE.populateGameFromDictionary().
    U3. Wrap stone bag array in a class with pull method that depletes bag. 

> Enhancements
    E1. Enhance ArgParser to support case insensitive args (see TODO marker).
    E2. Enhance ArgParser.addArgsFromString(), Add check for arg (and assoc val) already in array.

> Documentation
    D1. Update Object Libary.txt with current as built information.
    D2. Create additional Use Cases (help drive class method definition)

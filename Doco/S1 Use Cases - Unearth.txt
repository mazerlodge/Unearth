S1 Use Cases - Unearth

Goal - Define use cases for incremental development of the Unearth project.

> Scratch Examples
- Start the game engine with a '-test 1' parameter that generates required params to do a simple "power on" sequence.
    -- Test 1 outputs shuffled deck contents

> Start up tests
    1. Generate decks, outputs them.
    // First w/out shuffling, then after verifying all cards there, w/ shuffle

    2. Collect all player questions, stores in player, outputs answers.
    // Implies game class (UGE) has players collection.

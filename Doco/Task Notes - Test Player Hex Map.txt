Task Notes - Test Player Hex Map

Goal - In the player class a PlayerHexMap of HexCells represents the player map.  Each HexCell contains a HexTile, which may be either a Wonder or a Stone. Test the ability to store and retrieve either within the HexCell.

Concept - The player hex map isn't pre-built.  First title is put at position 50,50 and additional tiles are
            built around it by specifying where to place a tile relative to some other tile.

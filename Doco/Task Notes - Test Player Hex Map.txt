Task Notes - Test Player Hex Map

Goal - In the player class a HexMap of HexCells represents the player map.  Each HexCell contains a HexTile, which may be either a Wonder or a Stone. Test the ability to store and retrieve either within the HexCell.


Reference
----------
Use Case U1. Populate a player map with a lesser wonder surrounded with mix of colors.


POA Concept - The player hex map isn't pre-built.  First title is put at position 50,50
				and additional tiles are built around it by specifying where to place
				a tile relative to some other tile.
            
Use Case / User Scenario / Walk through 
	Launch app with Test 12 selected. 
	Place a random stone at the default start location (50,50) 
	Place the following subsequent stones at the relative locations specified:
		stone 	relpos of previous tile
		(R)		starting stone at 50,50 
		R		N
		Y		SE		
		Y		S
		B		SW
		B		NW
		K		N
		K		NE
		
		(Red, Yellow, Blue, blacK) 
		  
	Pseudocode 
		hexCells = playerMap.gethexCells() 
		if (hexCells.length > 1) 
			index = cli.askUserWhichCell(hexCells) 
		else 
			index = 0 
		playerMap.placeHexTile: theTile inHexCell: hexCells[index]
